### Welcome

This repository is used to demonstrate the performance characteristics of a merge graph under
different simulated loads.

#### How does it work

The load imparted onto the connected queue is controlled by the `mq.toml` file in the .config
folder. The PR Factory workflow is set on a cron schedule to call `mq` which is then responsible for
generating the pull requests and enqueueing them.

The configuration system allows for setting the desired load on the queue, the flake rate and the
interdependence element of the pull requests.

```toml
# parallelqueue - will push deps information to the service to take advantage of trunk merge dynamic parallel queues
# singlequeue - single traditional queueu
mode = "singlequeue"

# Default value: "none"
#build = "none"

[git]
# Default value: "Jane Doe"
#name = "Jane Doe"

# Default value: "bot@email.com"
#email = "bot@email.com"

[pullrequest]
# Default value: ""
#labels = ""

# Default value: ""
#comment = ""

# Default value: "This pull request was generated by the 'mq' tool"
#body = "This pull request was generated by the 'mq' tool"

# Default value: 10
#requests_per_hour = 10

# Default value: 1
#max_deps = 1

# Default value: 1
#max_impacted_deps = 1

# Default value: 100 (create logical merge conflict every 100 PRs)
#logical_conflict_every = 100

# Default value: "logical-conflict.txt"
#logical_conflict_file = "logical-conflict.txt"

# Default value: ["removed from the merge queue", "To merge this pull request, check the box to the left"]
#detect_stale_pr_comments = ["removed from the merge queue", "To merge this pull request, check the box to the left"]

# Default value: "4 hours"
#close_stale_after = "4 hours"

# Default value: "1 second"
